      <h2>Budget Gaming PC:</h2>
      <p>Building a budget gaming PC focuses on maximizing the performance for gaming while keeping costs low. Key components include a decent quad-core or hexa-core processor, a mid-range graphics card, and at least 8GB of RAM. Prioritize a dedicated GPU over an integrated one, as it significantly affects gaming performance. A budget gaming PC may lack features like ray tracing, but it will still run most games at decent frame rates and resolutions.</p>
      <p>Cost limitations may result in less powerful components, less storage, or a less attractive case. However, you can always upgrade components as your budget allows in the future. Remember, it's all about finding the perfect balance between performance and cost.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="buildsection">
      <h2>Budget Workstation:</h2>
      <p>A budget workstation focuses on productivity tasks, such as video editing, 3D rendering, and other compute-intensive workloads. Key components include a multi-core processor (ideally with hyperthreading), a mid-range GPU, and at least 16GB of RAM. Storage should be a combination of fast SSDs for the operating system and frequently accessed files, and larger HDDs for long-term storage.</p>
      <p>While a budget workstation may not have the top-tier components found in high-end workstations, it can still handle many demanding tasks. Keep in mind that performance will be limited by the budget, but upgrades can always be made over time as funds become available.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="buildsection">
      <h2>Budget Silent Compact PC:</h2>
      <p>A budget silent compact PC aims to minimize noise and size without sacrificing too much performance. Key components include a low-power processor with integrated graphics, a small form-factor motherboard, and an efficient cooling solution. Silent PCs often use passive or semi-passive cooling solutions, such as large heatsinks, low-RPM fans, or fanless designs.</p>
      <p>Due to its compact size and focus on silence, a budget silent PC may have limitations in terms of performance and upgradability. However, it's perfect for those who require a quiet, unobtrusive system for everyday tasks, light gaming, or media consumption.</p>
