	<h1>How to Install an OS - Bringing Your Beast to Life</h1>
	<p>Once you've built your beastly PC, it's time to breathe life into it by installing an operating system (OS). The OS is the software that manages your computer's hardware and allows you to interact with it using a graphical interface.</p>
	<p>Here at CheapBeast, we'll guide you through the process of installing an OS, whether you choose Windows, macOS, or Linux. We'll provide step-by-step instructions and tips to ensure a smooth installation experience.</p>
	<p>Ready to awaken your beast? Let's dive into the world of OS installation!</p>
	<h2>Installing an Operating System: A Beginner's Guide</h2>
<p>Welcome to the thrilling world of operating system installation! Don't worry, we promise it's more fun than it sounds. Installing an OS for the first time might seem like a daunting task, but with a little guidance, you'll be up and running in no time. So buckle up, and let's dive right into the process.</p>
<br><p>First things first, you'll need to decide on an operating system. Windows is the most popular choice for gaming and general use, while macOS is the go-to for Apple fans (note that macOS is exclusive to Apple hardware). For those who love open-source software and customization, Linux is a great option. Once you've picked your OS, you'll need to acquire the installation media. This typically involves downloading an ISO file (a digital copy of the OS) and creating a bootable USB drive or burning it to a DVD. There are plenty of tools available online to help you create bootable media, such as Rufus for Windows or Etcher for Linux distributions.</p>
<br><p>Now that you have your bootable media ready, it's time for the main event. Turn off your freshly built PC and plug in the USB drive or insert the DVD. Power on the system and enter the BIOS by pressing the appropriate key (usually Delete, F2, or F12) during the boot process. Once you're in the BIOS, navigate to the boot settings and set your installation media as the primary boot device. Save your changes and restart your computer. Your PC should now boot from the installation media and initiate the OS installation process.</p>
<pre class="entering bios">
 How to enter BIOS!
 Just follow the easy-as-pie steps below and make me proud, soldier.
  1. Power on your PC.
  2. Press the appropriate key (Del, F2, F12).
  3. Navigate to the boot settings.
  4. Set installation media as the primary boot device.
  5. Save changes and restart your computer.

  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #cccccc;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-family: monospace;
}

<p>Once you've started the installation process, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. This will involve selecting your language, choosing your keyboard layout, and setting up user accounts. The installer will also guide you through partitioning your hard drive or SSD, which is where you'll allocate space for your new operating system. Finally, the OS will be installed, and after a reboot, you'll be greeted with your brand-new, shiny desktop environment. Congratulations, you've successfully installed an operating system!</p>
