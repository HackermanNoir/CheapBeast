		<h2>Step-by-Step Guide: Building Your First PC - The Hilariously Easy Way!</h2>
		<p>Are you ready to build your first PC, but don't know where to start? Fear not! At CheapBeast, we've got your back (and your motherboard). Follow our comical, yet informative step-by-step guide to building your first beast on a budget!</p>
    	<ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare Your Workspace:</strong> Clear an area large enough to assemble your PC, preferably not on a carpeted floor. If possible, wear an anti-static wristband to avoid frying your precious components. No wristband? No problem! Just touch a metal object frequently to discharge any static. Alternatively, breakdance on the carpet to assert your dominance over static electricity (not recommended).</li>
    
            <li><strong>Install the CPU:</strong> Open the CPU socket on your motherboard and gently place the CPU in, making sure to align the notches. Remember, it's not a sandwich, so don't force it down!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Install the CPU Cooler:</strong> Attach the CPU cooler to the motherboard. If it's a fancy aftermarket one, don't forget the thermal paste. Apply a pea-sized amount, or draw a smiley face if you're feeling artistic.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Install RAM:</strong> Locate the RAM slots, and push down the tabs on both ends. Insert the RAM sticks with a bit of force until the tabs click back into place. If you're having trouble, try turning it off and on again (just kidding, they're notched, so make sure they're aligned correctly).</li>
    
            <li><strong>Install the Motherboard:</strong> Secure the motherboard to your case using the provided screws. We recommend using a screwdriver, but if you're feeling adventurous, try a chopstick or a toothpick. (Please don't.)</li>
    
            <li><strong>Install the PSU:</strong> Mount the power supply unit in your case, making sure the fan is facing the right way. After installing, use the cables to connect your motherboard, CPU, and storage drives. We promise, it's not as hard as untangling your headphones!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Install the GPU:</strong> Find the PCIe slot and gently insert the graphics card until it clicks into place. Secure it with a screw, and remember, "GPU" stands for "Gigantic Party Unicorn" (it doesn't, but it's fun to imagine).</li>
    
            <li><strong>Connect Everything:</strong> Connect all the cables from the case, PSU, and drives to the appropriate headers on the motherboard. It's like an adult version of connecting the dots!</li>
    
            <li><strong>Test Your Build:</strong> Double-check all connections, then power up your PC. If it doesn't work, don't panic! Take a deep breath, grab some snacks, and calmly troubleshoot the issue. If it does work, celebrate by doing a victory dance!</li>
